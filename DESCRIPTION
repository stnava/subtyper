Title: Subtyping, Filtering and Visualization for Longitudinal Population Data
Description: We ingest dataframes describing populations that are followed
    longitudinally, potentially with repeat measurements at each visit/timepoint.
    Subtypes are identified after filtering the data frame for good quality.
    Training the subtyping method can be performed after covariates adjustment.
    Training is made explicit and its results are captured in an intuitive data
    frame detailing results.  Inference or prediction of subtypes in new data
    is facilitated by a single function call. The package provides intuitive
    visualization that show how subtyped data varies by group over time.
