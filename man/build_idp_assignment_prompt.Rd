\title{Build Prompt for Functional Network Assignment}
\usage{
build_idp_assignment_prompt(
  regions,
  instruction_level = c("concise", "detailed"),
  format = c("structured", "json")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{regions}{A character vector of brain region names.}

\item{instruction_level}{Level of detail in instructions to the LLM.
Options are "concise" (minimal prompt) or "detailed" (more structured guidance).}

\item{format}{Output format requested from the LLM.
Options are "structured" (numbered list) or "json" (strict JSON).}
}
\value{
A character string containing the full prompt to provide to the LLM.
}
\description{
This function generates a standardized prompt to query an LLM for
functional/phenotypic network assignments of brain regions. The LLM is
instructed to return both a short-form label and a long-form explanation.
You can optionally enforce JSON-like output for easier parsing.
