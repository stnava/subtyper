\title{Rank Methods by Weighted Performance Using Various Normalization Strategies}
\usage{
rank_methods_by_performance(df, id_col, weights_df, method = "rank")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{The performance data frame.}

\item{id_col}{A character string specifying the unique identifier column in \code{df}.}

\item{weights_df}{A data frame defining the metrics, weights, and directions.}

\item{method}{The normalization method to use. Must be one of \code{"rank"} (default),
\code{"minmax"}, or \code{"zscore"}.}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
\item{ranked_df}{A tibble with all original columns plus the new rank/score.}
\item{gt_table}{A \code{gt} table object, formatted for presentation.}
}
\description{
This function ranks methods based on a set of performance metrics, using one
of three user-selected normalization strategies: rank averaging, min-max
scaling, or Z-scoring. This version resolves all known syntax errors.
