\title{Scale Continuous Predictors in a Data Frame Based on a Model Formula}
\usage{
scale_predictors_from_formula(data, formula)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing all the variables mentioned in the formula.}

\item{formula}{A model formula object (e.g., \code{Outcome ~ Predictor1 + (1 | Group)}).
The function will scale all numeric variables on the right-hand side of the \code{~}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same dimensions as the input, but with the
continuous numeric predictors scaled and centered.
}
\description{
This function prepares a data frame for modeling by standardizing all continuous
numeric predictors specified in a formula. It intelligently parses the formula
to identify the outcome variable (which is never scaled) and all predictors.
Each numeric predictor is then scaled to have a mean of 0 and a standard
deviation of 1 (Z-scoring).
