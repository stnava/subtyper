\title{Generate a Prompt for Interpreting Brain–Behavior Associations}
\usage{
generate_idp_interpretation_prompt(
  response_length = c("short", "medium", "long"),
  tone = c("critical", "skeptical", "neutral"),
  n_examples = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{response_length}{Character. Desired length of justification.
One of: "short" (2–3 sentences), "medium" (3–6), "long" (5–8).}

\item{tone}{Character. Interpretive stance. One of:
"neutral", "skeptical", "critical".}

\item{n_examples}{Integer. Number of exemplar cases to include (0–5).}
}
\value{
A character string containing the full prompt.
}
\description{
Constructs a standardized prompt for guiding large language models
in interpreting statistical associations between imaging-derived
phenotypes (IDPs) and human performance measures.
}
\details{
The model is required to return a strict JSON object with exactly
three keys:
\itemize{
\item "consistency"   : low / medium / high
\item "justification" : academic explanation
\item "plausibility"  : continuous numeric score between zero and one \link{0.0–1.0}
}
}
