\title{Compute ASymmetry-Adjusted Mean (ASAM) for Asymmetry Analysis}
\usage{
asam(left, right, weight = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{left}{Numeric. The value representing the left side of the measurement.}

\item{right}{Numeric. The value representing the right side of the measurement.}

\item{weight}{Numeric. increase weight on asymmetry portion of equation.}
}
\value{
Numeric value representing the Symmetry-Adjusted Mean (SAM).
}
\description{
This function computes the Symmetry-Adjusted Mean (SAM) between two values, typically representing
the left and right measurements of a structure. SAM is a combined metric that incorporates both
the average value and the asymmetry between the two sides.
}
\details{
The formula is:
\deqn{ASAM = \frac{Left + Right}{2} - |Left - Right|}

This metric captures both the overall size (average) and the degree of asymmetry between the two sides.
\subsection{Thought Experiment Explanation:}{

Consider a comparison between two groups (e.g., Control and Disease) where you want to assess
differences in both the size and symmetry of a structure, such as the left and right hippocampus:
\itemize{
\item In the \strong{Control} group, where symmetry is expected, SAM will be close to the average of the two sides.
\item In the \strong{Disease} group, where asymmetry is expected, SAM will be lower due to the subtraction of the absolute difference between the left and right sides.
}

This metric is insightful because it combines information about both the structure's size and symmetry,
allowing it to reflect differences in both characteristics.

\examples{
# Example usage:
left <- 5
right <- 3
asam(left, right)

# For a symmetric case:
asam(5, 5)
