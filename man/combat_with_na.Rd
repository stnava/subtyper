\title{Apply ComBat Batch Correction While Preserving Missing Data}
\usage{
combat_with_na(df, batch)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A numeric matrix or data frame with missing values (NA) that you want to adjust for batch effects.}

\item{batch}{A numeric or character vector containing the batch assignments (must have the same length as the number of samples in \code{df}).}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix or data frame with batch effects corrected, while preserving the original NA values from \code{df}.
}
\description{
This function performs batch effect correction using the ComBat method from the \code{sva} package. It applies ComBat to the data after imputing missing values, but preserves the missing data (NA values) in the output.
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'df' is your data frame with missing values and 'batch' is a vector of batch assignments
adjusted_data <- combat_with_na(df, batch)

}
